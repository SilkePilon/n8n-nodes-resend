# Resend Nodes for n8n

## Overview

This package provides comprehensive n8n nodes to interact with the Resend email platform. It allows you to:

*   **Email Operations:** Send, get, update, and cancel emails
*   **Contact Management:** Create, get, update, and delete contacts in audiences
*   **Audience Management:** Create, get, update, and delete audiences
*   **Domain Management:** Create, get, update, verify, and delete domains
*   **API Key Management:** Create and delete API keys
*   **Broadcast Management:** Create, get, and update email broadcasts
*   **Webhook Processing:** Receive and process webhook events from Resend

This integration uses the official [Resend API](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) and provides full coverage of all available endpoints.

## Prerequisites/Setup

*   You need a Resend account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com/).
*   For detailed information about the Resend API, refer to the official [API Documentation](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

## Credentials Setup (`ResendApi`)

To use these nodes, you need to configure the "Resend API" credentials in n8n:

1.  In your n8n workspace, go to **Credentials** and click **Add credential**.
2.  Search for "Resend API" and select it.
3.  Fill in the required field:
    *   **API Key**: Your Resend API key.
4.  You can find your API Key in your Resend dashboard under **API Keys** ([https://resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)). Create a new API key if you haven't already, ensuring it has the necessary permissions (e.g., "Full access" for sending emails).
5.  Save the credential.

### Resend Trigger Node

#### Setup

1.  **Add the `Resend Trigger` node** to your n8n workflow.
2.  **Configure the node parameters:**
    *   **Webhook Signing Secret**: Enter your Resend webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`). You'll get this from step 4 below.
    *   **Events**: Select the specific email events you want Resend to send to your n8n trigger.
3.  **Copy the webhook URL**: In the trigger node, you'll see a webhook URL displayed. Copy this URL (use the test URL while building your workflow, and the production URL when the workflow is activated).
4.  **Configure webhook in Resend dashboard:**
    *   Navigate to **API** -> **Webhooks** in your Resend dashboard ([https://resend.com/webhooks](https://resend.com/webhooks)).
    *   Click **Add webhook**.
    *   Paste the copied n8n webhook URL into the "Webhook URL" field.
    *   Select the same events that you configured in your n8n trigger node.
    *   Save the webhook configuration.
    *   Copy the **Webhook Signing Secret** that Resend displays (starts with `whsec_`).
5.  **Add the signing secret**: Go back to your n8n `Resend Trigger` node and paste the signing secret into the **Webhook Signing Secret** parameter.

#### Supported Events

The trigger node supports all Resend webhook event types:

*   **Email Events:**
    *   `email.sent` - Email was sent successfully
    *   `email.delivered` - Email was delivered to the recipient
    *   `email.delivery_delayed` - Email delivery was delayed
    *   `email.complained` - Recipient marked email as spam

#### Security

The trigger node automatically verifies webhook signatures using the Svix library to ensure webhooks are coming from Resend. This prevents unauthorized webhook calls to your n8n workflow.

*   Email ID and message details
*   Recipient information
*   Timestamp of the event
*   Event-specific data (e.g., bounce reason, click data)
